      in the browser with little effort. Use the css toolkit to design your own

        alt="Simple representation of a grid layout overlayed in blue">
      Grid Layout is a new layout model for CSS that has powerful abilities
      to control the sizing and positioning of boxes and their contents. Unlike
      Flexbox, which is single-axis oriented, Grid Layout is optimized for
      2-dimensional layouts.

      Blogophonic has form to email capabilities built right in, all you need
      to do is include your email address in the front matter of the contact
      page. Giving this template away is, in fact, an elaborate ploy to get you
      to try Formspree!
